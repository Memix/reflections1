How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can check my steps and make my code better.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
you decide yourself when to comming otherwise commits maybe will not be a full problem solve or file will be saved in the middle of writing a code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google Docs is not meant for coding.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
you can keep track of changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
becouse you can still return to previous version of codes you wrote.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
making an android app! :D
